    "* The dataset is **versioned**. As of 2023-11-03, the latest version is v1, which is based on a database dump from 2023-09-10.

    "\n",
    "- `attack_id`: unique ID for the attack (should be sequential).\n",
    "- `attacker_id_anonymized`: an identifier for the attacker. Note that these are _different_ identifiers to the ones used on the Tensor Trust website, to make it a little bit harder to look up the access code for any defender.\n",
    "- `defender_id_anonymized`: defender ID, anonymized in the same way as the attacker ID.\n",
    "- `defense_id`: links to `defense_id` that links into the raw defenses dataset, shown below. **Not every row has this.** In particular, some very old attacks have no `defense_id` because of the way the game originally stored data, and \"sandbox\" attacks have no `defense_id` because they are not attacks on any specific player.\n",
    "- `attacker_balance_before`/`defender_balance_before`: How much money did the attacker and defender have at the time of the attack? **Not every row has this**, since we didn't record it early on in the game.\n",
    "- `attacker_balance_gain`/`defender_balance_gain`: If the attacker gained money from the attack, how much did they gain? Similar for the defender. Note that originally attackers _lost_ money for each attack; this is not captured by this field.\n",
    "- `opening_defense`/`closing_defense`: Defense prompt for the defender. **These fields may be null in some rows**, since we removed ToS-violating text from these fields.\n",
    "- `access_code`: The defender's actual access code. **May be null** if it violated the ToS.\n",
    "- `attacker_input:` The attack submitted by the attacker against the defender. **May be null** if it violated the ToS.\n",
    "- `llm_output`: Output of the LLM in response to the attack. **May be null** if it violated the ToS.\n",
    "- `output_is_access_granted`: Does the LLM output match our \"access granted\" regex?\n",
    "- `is_self_attack`: Was the user attacking themselves? This happens when a user is testing their own defense, or using the attack sandbox.\n",
    "- `timestamp`: Date on which the attack was saved (ISO8601 format).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `defense_id` column can probably be ignored for most purposes, since most of the information is already captured in the `opening_defense`/`closing_defense`/`access_code` fields; we include this column just as a convenience for looking up the defense objects themselves, which have slightly more information about the defense (like the LLM output, and the time the defense was created).\n",

    "- `opening_defense`/`access_code`/`closing_defense`: defense prompt and access code for the defender. **These may be null** in a very small set of cases due to ToS violations.\n",
    "- `llm_output`: what did the LLM output when the user tried to save the defense? Should be \"access granted\" for valid defenses (modulo exceptions allowed by our regular expression). May also be null for ToS violation.\n",

    "- `timestamp`: date at which the defense was saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **some defenses in the attack table are absent from the defense table**. This is because we changed the database schema early in development, and did not store defenses separately from attacks before that change. Also, any \"sandbox\" attacks will have a missing defense ID."
